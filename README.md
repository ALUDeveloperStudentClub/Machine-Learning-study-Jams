# Machine-Learning-study-Jams
The series is dedicated to anyone interested in Machine Learning - From Python Basics to ML Models and APIs 

We are happy to announce the launch of our new workshop series - "Machine Learning Study Jams". The series is dedicated to anyone interested in learning the basics of Machine Learning. 

Here's what our series offers:

‚≠ê Python Basics: Master variables, loops, functions, and data types.

‚≠ê Math Fundamentals: Strengthen your understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics.

‚≠ê Data Structures & Algorithms: Explore arrays, linked lists, trees, sorting, and searching.

‚≠ê ML Models & APIs: Learn to utilize ML models and APIs for practical applications.

‚≠ê Expert Fireside Chat: Engage with an ML pro for insights and guidance.



During this first event, we will explain the basic syntax of the language, and create our first project in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Volunteers from the club will be there to help and delve into the language together.

üìç Location: Benin 

üìÖEvents will be held every Friday, starting from 223rd Feb  to March!

This is an opportunity to connect, learn, and grow with GDSC's inclusive Machine Learning series!
