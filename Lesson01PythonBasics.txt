**Check list to Python programming**

Introduction to Python:

Brief history and importance of Python, Python as an Interpreted Language , as a programming Language
Installing Python and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like PyCharm or Jupyter Notebook.

**Basic Syntax:**

Variables and data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans).
Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, //, %).
Printing output using the print() function.

Activity: Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user, adds them, and prints the result.

**Conditional Statements:**

if, elif, and else statements.
Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=).
Logical operators (and, or, not).

Activity: Write a program that asks the user for their age and prints whether they are eligible to vote or not.

**Loops:**

for loops and while loops.
Using loops to iterate over lists, tuples, and strings.

Activity: Write a program that prints all the even numbers between 1 and 20 using a loop.

**Lists and Tuples:**

Creating and accessing elements in lists and tuples.
List and tuple methods (append(), insert(), remove(), count(), etc.).
Activity: Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input from the user, calculates the sum of all the numbers, and prints the result.

**Strings:**

String concatenation and formatting.
String methods (upper(), lower(), split(), etc.).
Activity: Write a program that asks the user for their first name and last name, then prints their full name in uppercase.

**Functions:**

Defining and calling functions.
Function parameters and return values.
Activity: Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

**Input/Output:**

Getting user input using the input() function.
Reading from and writing to files.
Activity: Write a program that asks the user for their favorite color, stores it in a file, and then reads and prints the color from the file.

**Exception Handling:**

Using try, except, finally blocks to handle errors gracefully.

Activity: Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, catches any ValueError exceptions, and prints a message indicating whether the input was valid or not.

**Introduction to Libraries:**

Importing and using libraries/modules (e.g., random, math).
Activity: Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess it.

Project (Optional):

Encourage students to work on a small project to apply what they've learned, such as a simple calculator, a guessing game, or a to-do list manager, Hangman game
